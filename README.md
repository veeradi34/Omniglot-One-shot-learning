# Omniglot Dataset Exploration and Clustering

Welcome to the **Omniglot Dataset Exploration and Clustering** repository! This project focuses on exploring the Omniglot dataset and applying unsupervised learning techniques to group characters into clusters based on their visual features.

## Overview

The Omniglot dataset consists of handwritten characters from 50 different alphabets, making it a standard benchmark for few-shot learning and clustering tasks. The goal of this project is to extract meaningful features from the dataset and apply clustering algorithms to group similar characters.



## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/veeradi34/Omniglot-One-shot-learning.git
cd Omniglot-One-shot-learning
```


## Dataset

The Omniglot dataset can be downloaded from [this link](https://github.com/brendenlake/omniglot). Extract the dataset into the `data/` directory before running the code.


## Results

- The project demonstrates how unsupervised algorithms can group similar handwritten characters.
- Comparison of different clustering algorithms based on their performance metrics.
- Insights into how different feature extraction methods impact clustering quality.

## Contributing

Feel free to fork this repository and submit pull requests. Any contributions to improve the feature extraction pipeline, clustering algorithms, or visualizations are welcome!
